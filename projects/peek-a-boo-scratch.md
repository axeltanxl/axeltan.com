title: 'Peek-a-Boo Game (Scratch)'
---

This is a game I created in Scratch while working on the Harvard CS50x course. Instructions: The goal in this game is to tap the cat with the dog as quickly as possible. However, you can only move the dog by pressing the right arrow key when the cat isn't looking!
