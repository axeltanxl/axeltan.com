title: 'Brightsparks App'
---

A simple app I coded using Java and XML to ease the scholarship application process using the Brightsparks portal. It does away with having to constantly use our web browsers to search for the website. It gives users the full experience of the Brightsparks portal, allowing them to apply for scholarships, check the scholarship applications and pursue higher education, all in one app.
