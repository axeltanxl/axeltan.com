# Personal Website

This is my personal website hosted on GitHub Pages, created with Jekyll using the [Jekyll theme by Paul Le.](https://github.com/LeNPaul/portfolio-jekyll-theme)

I made some customisations to the theme and enabled some built-in integrations, including:
- Adding dark mode that is automatically enabled based on the user's browser settings
- Changing the landing page of the website to the Blog page
- Using my personal domain for the website
- Enabling Disqus comments
- Enabling Contact Forms with Formspree
