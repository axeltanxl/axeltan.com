After about a month of studying, I took the [**LPI Linux Essentials exam**](https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/linux-essentials-overview) today and passed with a score of 670/800 (34/40)! I took the exam via the online proctoring option with Pearson Vue. Although I could have travelled down to a test centre to take the exam, I preferred the flexibility that came with taking the exam online. Instead of waking up early to commute to the test centre, I could have breakfast from the comfort of my home and wait for the check-in time.

#### Studying materials

I relied heavily on Udemy and my Ubuntu machine to prepare for this exam. I took the [**Linux Essentials course**](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-essentials-010/) offered by Jason Dion on Udemy to learn the basic concepts of Linux. I found the course rather easy to understand because I already had experience using Linux, as Ubuntu has been my daily driver for almost 4 years now. I took notes throughout the course and practiced every command that was introduced. I used the terminal on my computer to practice the commands and read the manual pages for the commands to learn more about them. I also practiced editing documents using the Vi text editor, and learnt basic shell scripting. I also learnt about networking in Linux and how to troubleshoot basic network problems on Linux. Finally, I learnt all about managing accounts and files, using commands such as `chmod`, `chgrp` and `chown`. After the course, I practiced by applying my knowledge to answer test questions. For this, Jason also offers [**this course with 6 full practice papers**](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-essentials-practice-exams/) for to prepare for the exam. I completed all the practice papers, making sure to sharpen my knowledge on the questions I got wrong. Then, I retook 4 exams and was consistently achieving scores of 85% or more. That made me feel ready for the exam and I went ahead to schedule my exam.

#### Online exam experience

It was my first time taking a monitored exam online, so I was a bit nervous as I did not know what to expect. I checked in 30 minutes before the exam (the earliest I could check in) so that the proctor could verify my identity and ensure the ensure the integrity of the area I will be taking the exam from. To do so, I had to take photos of my IC, as well as pictures of the front, back, left and right of my work area and upload it to a website. Within 5 minutes, I was verified and the exam was presented to me. Pearson Vue uses a software called "OnVue" to deliver the exam. We were required to download the software and perform a system test before the exam. Throughout the exam, I was monitored through a webcam by a proctor to ensure that I was alone and not attempting to cheat. I had to be very careful to not even mumble to myself as I've read online that it can cause my exam to be revoked. I calmed myself down before starting the exam. I read every question carefully, looking out for keywords that could trigger certain concepts in my mind. This would be my tip to anyone trying to tackle the exam. I finished the exam in roughly 30 minutes, and I spent the next 10 minutes checking through my answers to make sure I did not make any careless mistakes. Once I was confident enough of my answers, I submitted my answers and ended the exam. Before I could view my results, I needed to complete a survey to rate the experience of taking the exam online. Once I completed the survey, the exam results was shown on the screen with a message that congratulated me, telling me that I had passed the exam.

Overall, it was a smooth process taking the exam online. I definitely recommend giving it a try if possible, as it offers so much convenience. It might even be the only option, as test centers are being shut down in response to the ongoing pandemic. In the meantime, I will continue to learn and study for my next certification, which is the CompTIA A+. Without a doubt, I will be taking the exam online again.
