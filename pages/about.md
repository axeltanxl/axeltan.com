# About Me

<img src="/assets/profile-pic.jpg" alt="profile-pic" width="200" align=right style="border-radius:50%"/>

Hi, I'm Axel Tan. I enjoy learning about the latest technologies and trends in IT. My interests lie primarily in Cloud technologies ☁️, DevOps ♾️ and automation 🤖. To further enhance my knowledge in these areas, I'm studying for certifications and doing side projects. I created this website to share my learning journey, showcase some of my side projects and blog about what I've learnt.

I recently completed serving National Service as an Air Force Technician ✈️, and I will be studying Computer Science at SMU this year. Currently, I'm working as a Desktop Support Engineer for Panasonic. I also volunteer on a weekly basis with [Touch Young Arrows](https://www.touch.org.sg/about-touch/our-services/touch-young-arrows-homepage) 💘, the branch of Touch Community Services providing mentoring programmes for underprivileged children. During the weekly mentoring sessions, we provide English and Mathematics tuition to the children, followed by a session of Values Driven Activity (VDA), in which we inculcate in them values that will help them grow and develop.

I spend most of my time at home learning and practising with a range of technologies. The tools and technologies I am learning/will be learning include:

- **AWS** ☁️
    - Solutions architect
- **Linux** 🐧
    - System administration
    - Shell scripting
    - Security & hardening
- **Python** 🐍
    - Scripting
- **Docker** 🚢
- **Kubernetes** ☸️
- **Terraform** 🇹

When I feel like taking a break, I like to immerse myself in sports, be it playing or watching football ⚽. I also enjoy browsing through Reddit.

To validate my knowledge and challenge myself, I'm also pursuing IT certifications. Listed below are some of the certifications I've obtained:
- [LPI Linux Essentials](lpi-linux-essentials-resources-and-online-exam-experience) (010-160) \[14/5/2021\]
- CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1001) \[6/6/2021\]
- CompTIA A+ Core 2 (200-1002) \[16/8/2021\]
- AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C02) \[28/11/2021\]

Thanks for stopping by!
