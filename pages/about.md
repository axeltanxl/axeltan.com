# About Me

<img src="/assets/me.jpeg" alt="pic" width="200" align=right style="border-radius:50%"/>

Hi, I'm Axel Tan. I'm currently a Computer Science freshman at Singapore Management University. I enjoy learning about the latest technologies and trends in IT. My interests lie primarily in Cloud technologies ☁️, DevOps ♾️ and scalable systems. I created this website to share my learning journey, showcase some of my side projects and blog about what I've learnt.

The tools and technologies I am proficient with include:

- **AWS** ☁️
- **Linux** 🐧
- **Python** 🐍

Some of the technologies I'm currently learning include:

- **Docker** 🚢
- **Kubernetes** ☸️
- **Terraform** 🇹

I have been volunteering on a weekly basis with [Touch Young Arrows](https://www.touch.org.sg/about-touch/our-services/touch-young-arrows-homepage) 💘 since January 2021, providing mentoring programmes for underprivileged children. During the weekly mentoring sessions, we provide English and Mathematics tuition to the children, followed by a session of Values Driven Activity (VDA), in which we inculcate in them values that will help them grow and develop.

When I feel like taking a break, I like to immerse myself in sports, be it playing or watching football ⚽. I also enjoy browsing through Reddit.

To validate my knowledge and challenge myself, I'm also pursuing IT certifications. Listed below are some of the certifications I've obtained:
- [LPI Linux Essentials](lpi-linux-essentials-resources-and-online-exam-experience) (010-160) \[14/5/2021\]
- CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1001) \[6/6/2021\]
- CompTIA A+ Core 2 (200-1002) \[16/8/2021\]
- AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C02) \[28/11/2021\]
- GitLab Certified Associate \[31/12/2021\]
- CompTIA Linux+ (XK1-005) \[13/2/2022\]
- Linux Foundation Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) \[8/6/2022\]
