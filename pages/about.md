# About Me

<img src="/assets/profile-pic.jpg" alt="profile-pic" width="200" style="border-radius:50%"/>

Hi, I'm Axel Tan. I enjoy learning about the latest technologies and trends in IT. My interests lie primarily in Cloud technologies ‚òÅÔ∏è, DevOps ‚ôæÔ∏è and automation ü§ñ. To further enhance my knowledge in these areas, I'm studying for certifications and doing side projects. I created this website to share my learning journey, my thoughts and reflections on trending technology topics and to showcase some of the projects I am working on.

I'm currently serving National Service as an Air Force Technician ‚úàÔ∏è, and I will be studying Information Systems in university. I also volunteer on a weekly basis with [Touch Young Arrows](https://www.touch.org.sg/about-touch/our-services/touch-young-arrows-homepage) üíò, the branch of Touch Community Services providing mentoring programmes for underprivileged children. During the weekly mentoring sessions, we provide English and Mathematics tuition to the children, followed by a session of Values Driven Activity (VDA), in which we inculcate in them values that will help them grow and develop.

I spend most of my time at home learning and practising with a range of technologies. The tools and technologies I am learning/will be learning include:

- **AWS** ‚òÅÔ∏è
    - Solutions architect, Developer, SysOps administrator
- **Linux** üêß
    - System administration
    - Shell scripting
- **Python** üêç
    - Web apps (with Flask)
    - REST APIs
    - Scripting

When I feel like taking a break, I like to engage in sporting activities (especially football ‚öΩ). I also enjoy watching football matches and browsing Reddit.

To validate my knowledge and challenge myself, I'm also pursuing IT certifications. Listed below are some of the certifications I've obtained:
- [LPI Linux Essentials](lpi-linux-essentials-resources-and-online-exam-experience) (010-160) \[14/5/2021\]
- CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1001) \[6/6/2021\]
- CompTIA A+ Core 2 (200-1002) \[16/8/2021\]

I am currently studying for:
- Cisco CCNA (200-301)
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C02)

Thanks for stopping by!
